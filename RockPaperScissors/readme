1: Make a function that will return randomly "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"
    - Create an option object (**options**) to store the possible values the computer can select.
    - Generate a random number between 1 - 3 and round it to a whole number and assign it to a variable (**choice**)
    - Depending on the number assigned to (**choice**), assign the value associated to it from the options object.
    - Return the (**choice**) variable and its value to the function.
2: Make a function to run the game round
    - Create two variables to store the player selection (**getPlayerSelection**) and computer selection (**getComputerSelection**) (redundant but it's what the challenge requested...)
